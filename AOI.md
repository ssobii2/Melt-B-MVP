### **Guide for Implementing the Interactive AOI Map Editor**

**Objective:** To replace the manual coordinate input form with a user-friendly, interactive map editor in the Admin Dashboard for creating and editing `DS-AOI` entitlements.

**User Experience Goal:** The admin should be able to visually draw, view, and modify an Area of Interest (AOI) directly on a map, and see how it relates to other existing AOIs.

### **Step-by-Step Functional Guide:**

#### **1. Initial State & Map Display**

1.  **Display the Interactive Map:** When the admin opens the "Create/Edit Entitlement" page, the form should display a fully interactive map.
2.  **Provide Drawing Tools:** The interface must include simple tools for the admin to create a shape:
    *   A "Draw Rectangle" button.
    *   A "Draw Polygon" button (for custom shapes).
    *   An "Edit Shape" button.
    *   A "Delete Shape" button.

#### **2. Creating a New AOI**

1.  **Initiate Drawing:** The admin clicks a drawing tool (e.g., "Draw Rectangle").
2.  **Draw on Map:** The admin clicks and drags on the map to define the new AOI's boundaries.
3.  **Capture Geometry:** As the admin finishes drawing, the system must automatically capture the geographic coordinates of the newly created shape. This captured data will be submitted with the form when saved.

#### **3. Editing an Existing AOI**

1.  **Load the Existing Shape:** When an admin edits an entitlement that already has an AOI, the map must automatically load and display the saved shape.
2.  **Enable Editing:** The admin can click the "Edit Shape" tool.
3.  **Modify the Shape:** The admin must be able to drag the corners (vertices) of the polygon to resize and reshape it.
4.  **Update Geometry:** As the shape is modified, the system must automatically update the captured GeoJSON data in the background, ready to be saved.

#### **4. Handling Existing and Overlapping AOIs (Crucial Feature)**

1.  **Display Other AOIs:** To prevent accidental overlaps and provide context, the map must **display all other existing AOIs** from the database as read-only, semi-transparent layers.
2.  **Visual Distinction:**
    *   The **current AOI being edited** should have a distinct style (e.g., solid, bright-colored border).
    *   **All other AOIs** should have a different, less prominent style (e.g., dashed, greyed-out border).
3.  **Support for Overlapping:** The system **should allow AOIs to overlap** if required by the business logic. The purpose of displaying them is to give the admin the information they need to make an informed decisionâ€”either to avoid an overlap or create one intentionally.

### **Backend vs. Frontend Work**

*   **Frontend Work (95% of the effort):**
    *   Integrating the map library and the drawing plugin.
    *   Handling the UI for the drawing tools.
    *   Implementing the logic to display the current AOI and all other AOIs with different styles.
    *   Capturing, storing (in state), and submitting the final GeoJSON data from the map.

*   **Backend Work (5% of the effort):**
    *   **Create one new API endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/entitlements/all-aois`. This endpoint will return a GeoJSON FeatureCollection of all existing AOI geometries from the `entitlements` table. The frontend will call this endpoint to get the data for the read-only layers.
    *   **Modify the existing "Save Entitlement" endpoint:** Ensure it can correctly receive the GeoJSON string from the form, validate it, and convert it to a PostGIS geometry before saving.
